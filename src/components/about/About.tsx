        <div className="textContainer">
            <p>My path to software development has been anything but linear. In school, my love for mathematics and physics led me to pursue a degree in Mathematical Physics, followed by a Masters and PhD in Particle Physics.
It was during my doctoral research that I first encountered programming; learning C++ for data analysis, alongside Fortran, Bash, and Perl scripting to manage computational jobs. These tools were merely instruments for scientific discovery, not ends in themselves.
After several years in physics research, I pivoted to education, experiencing technology from a completely different perspective, as a user rather than a creator. Watching various software products evolve over the years sparked a fundamental shift in my thinking. I began to see software development not simply as a tool for other disciplines, but as a fascinating field worthy of study in its own right.
While homeschooling my children, I pursued online programming courses that only deepened my growing interest. Eventually, I decided to take the leap and commit fully to this new path by enrolling in a software development bootcampâ€”transforming what began as scientific necessity into a passionate career pursuit.</p>
